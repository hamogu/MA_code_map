## Building

The /docs folder of this project is served on https://hamogu.github.io/MA_code_map/
At some point, I had a GH action to build those pages, but it required me to keep up-to-date with different versions of GH actions (build, upload artifacts etc.). Since, in the past few years, nobody except myself has pushed any changes, I might as well just build the pages locally with `python make_maps.py` and push the changes manually.
